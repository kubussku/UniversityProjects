22 zmienne posiadają powyżej 80% braków danych. Klasyfikuje je to do usunięcia ze zbioru.

Wnioski:  <br/>
- Braki w rapesPerPop i w rapes są takie same bo **rapesPerPop=rapes/population**  
- ViolentCrimesPerPop sa **MNAR**(mostly not at random) sa skorelowane z brakami rapes i assaults(takze skladniki violentcrimes)  
- nonViolPerPop są skorelowane z arsons, burglaries i autoTheft - skladniki nonViolPerPop - **MNAR**  
- Braki w robberies, assaults, burglaries, larcenies, autoTheft - **MCAR**.
